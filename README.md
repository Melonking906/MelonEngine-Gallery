# MelonEngine-Gallery

This is a simple virtual gallery that runs on MelonEngine. Feel free to use this gallery on your own site with your own artworks.

Simply replace the images in /3d/sprites with your own pictures to customise the gallery.

The gallery must be run in a webserver it will not run from file!
